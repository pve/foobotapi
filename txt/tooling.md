# Tooling
I am not doing much software development, so I am not interested in fully
featured development environments.
On top of that, we are targeting a runtime environment in the cloud.
Having said that, I am reasonably pleased with [Atom](https://atom.io).

## Software repository
Git is the number one tool here. For reasons explained elsewhere (integration
with Google, and publishing),
I am using both github, as well as the Google Cloud Source Repository.

Through Git's multiple remote features, this is manageable.
